# Migrate version 0.2.x to 0.3.x

All changes are documented in our [Changelog](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/shopware-pwa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

The 0.3.0 release introduces a couple of changes to

- API Client Endpoints
- API Client Interfaces

:::warning Important
Upgrading from shopware-pwa 0.2.x to 0.3.0 also requires upgrading your Shopware version from Shopware 6.2 to 6.3. Please note, that it is a coincidence, that Shopware 6.**3** is required to operate shopware-pwa 0.**3**. The might be future minor releases (0.4, 0.5 etc.) that still work on 6.3.
:::

You will always find an overview of version compatibilities within our [Compatibility Table](/landing/getting-started/prepare-shopware.html#compatibility-table).

### API Endpoints

We've incremented all API endpoint versions to v3, so we can make use of the newest additions - even the ones which aren't there yet, but might be added in v3.

Please make sure to update all your endpoints to that version as well. For future Shopware major releases, we will bump up the used version.

### API Client Interfaces

As not only the API version changes, but also the the endpoints that are provided, we had to mark some endpoints as deprecated. Please make sure to remove their usages from your project and use the suggested replacements. Find more information within our Changelog linked above.
