# Installation

Similar to the Shopware Core production and development templates it is possible to set up SESP either as a `dependency/composer` requirement but also as a development environment which allows you to do contributions to the plugin on its own.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to contribute, please contact the Shopware Sales department, so you will get access to the private repository.
