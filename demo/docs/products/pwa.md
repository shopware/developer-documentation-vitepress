# PWA

If you think about providing a decoupled storefront for customers you can use **Shopware PWA** as a base to do that. It is a Single Page Application based on JavaScript and Vue.js, that already integrates a whole lot of the Shopware functionality you know into a very extensible frontend application.

Shopware PWA is based on the [Store API](../concepts/api/store-api.md).
