# CLI Setup

The CLI is your tool to connect with your PaaS environment, push changes and trigger deployments etc.

## Download & Install

In order to install Shopware PaaS CLI, run the following command

```bash
curl -sfS https://cli.shopware.com/installer | php
```

## Add SSH key

For secure communication between your local machine and your PaaS environment, create a SSH key and add it to your Account using 

```
shopware ssh-key:add
```

and go through the steps provided. When you run the CLI for the first time, it will ask you to log in via your browser.

You can also generate a SSH key manually and add it in the **My profile > SSH Keys** section of your [PaaS Console](https://console.shopware.com/).
