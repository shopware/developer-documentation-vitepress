# Enterprise PaaS

Shopware Enterprise PaaS is a way to host, deploy and scale for your individual Shopware project.
It comes with the full flexibility and code ownership of a self-managed Shopware project, but takes away the complexity of building custom infrastructure, build & testing pipelines or deployment automation.
