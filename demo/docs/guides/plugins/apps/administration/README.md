# Administration

You can't extend the Shopware administration by means of freely overriding and extending administration components, all js files you provide in the `Resources/administration` namespace will be ignored. Instead, you have more defined extension points and can extend the administration by other means: You are able to [add your own modules](add-custom-modules.md), [custom fields](../custom-data.md) or [action buttons](add-custom-action-button.md) via manifest file.

Starting with version 6.4.2.0 you can also extend Shopware's CMS module by [adding custom CMS blocks](../content/cms/add-custom-cms-blocks.md).
