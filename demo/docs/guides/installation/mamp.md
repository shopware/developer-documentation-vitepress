## Overview

For quick and easy installation you can also use **MAMP** on Mac.

## Prerequisites

As a first step, please make sure you installed MAMP beforehand. You can download MAMP on [this site](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/).

## Preparation

### Configure PHP settings

First you have to modify the PHP settings inside MAMP as seen on the following screenshot:

![PHP settings](../../.gitbook/assets/10-mac-os-x-php.png)

After that start the mysql webserver-service with the toggle buttons on the left side in the MAMP management console.

### Prepare MySQL user & database

Open the **MySQL Tab** on the left side and click on the _PhpMyAdmin_ icon - if the icon is grayed out, check if the mysql and webserver services are running.

![Mysql settings](../../.gitbook/assets/10-mac-os-x-mysql.png)

Inside PhpMyAdmin switch to the user account management on the top menu and click _add new user_.

Choose a username \(e.g. shopware\) and a password and set the option _Create database with same name and grant all privileges_. Also, set the option _Check all_ in the **Global privileges** card. Afterwards, all checkboxes in this card should be checked.

Finish this step by clicking _GO_.

### Global usage

Next up, we need to make sure MAMP php binary is used globally on your CLI. Therefore we execute the following commands:

```bash
which php
# /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.14/bin/php &lt; should be displayed
# IF NOT
vim ~/.bash_profile
export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.14/bin:$PATH
# :wq to save the file
source ~/.bash_profile
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The folder used in `PATH` \(`PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.14/bin:$PATH`\) may change. Please look in the `php` folder for its current name.
{% endhint %}

Then you need to make sure MAMP mysql binary is used globally on your CLI:

```bash
which mysql
# /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql &lt; should be displayed
# IF NOT
vim ~/.bash_profile
export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin:$PATH
# :wq to save the file
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Install `brew`

It's handy to use brew as a package manager. So we recommend you to install brew. Please open the terminal application again and run the command stated below:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Install npm / node

Next step is installing NodeJS and NPM. Therefore you need to leave the terminal application open and use brew to install node:

```bash
brew install node@12
```

### Install composer

In order to install composer, please open the terminal application. Afterwards, execute the following command:

```bash
brew install composer
```

## Checkout shopware

Before you're able to set up Shopware, you need to checkout Shopware's repositories. This is explained in the "Preparatory steps" paragraph of the [Installation overview guide](overview.md). Nevertheless, below you see a brief summary on this process:

```bash
# Choose your own directory
cd ~/PhpstormProjects/
mkdir shopware
cd shopware
git clone https://github.com/shopware/development.git
cd development
git clone https://github.com/shopware/platform.git
```

## Shopware 6 setup in MAMP

First, add a new host in MAMP:

* Hostname = shopware
* Port = 8000
* Document Root = Browse for the public directory inside the new directory that you used before \(e.g. /PhpstormProjects/shopware/development/public\)

![hosts](../../.gitbook/assets/10-mac-os-x-net.png)

As a next step, change the installation settings

```bash
# Inside the shopware installation directory (e.g.  /PhpstormProjects/shopware/development)
bin/setup
```

You will be prompted to enter specific information. In short:

* Application environment: Just hit enter to apply the default `dev`
* URL to your /public folder: `http://shopware:8000`
* Database host: Just hit enter to apply the default `localhost`
* Database port: Just hit enter to apply the default `3306`
* Database name: Enter the name of your database that you created earlier, `shopware` was suggested
* Database user: Enter the name of your MySQL user, that you created previously
* Database password: Enter the password of the new MySQL user

Afterwards a file called `.psh.yaml.override` is created, which contains all those information you just entered.

### Start Shopware 6 setup

```bash
# Inside the shopware installation directory (e.g. /PhpstormProjects/shopware/development) 
./psh.phar install
```

After that the setup is done. You can now access your Shopware 6 installation using the following urls: 
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
* Storefront: [http://shopware:8000](http://shopware:8000)
* Admin: [http://shopware:8000/admin](http://shopware:8000/admin) \(User: admin, password: shopware\)
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

## Troubleshooting

There are cases when the administration is not build correctly and having error messages similar to these:

> ERROR in foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js Module Error \(from ./node\_modules/eslint-loader/index.js\):
>
> ✘ [https://google.com/\#q=import%2Fno-unresolved](https://google.com/#q=import%2Fno-unresolved) Casing of ./modules/sw-theme-manager does not match the underlying filesystem  
> foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js:1:8
>
> ✘ [https://google.com/\#q=import%2Fno-unresolved](https://google.com/#q=import%2Fno-unresolved) Casing of ./extension/sw-sales-channel/page/sw-sales-channel-detail does not match the underlying filesystem  
> foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js:3:8
>
> ✘ [https://google.com/\#q=import%2Fno-unresolved](https://google.com/#q=import%2Fno-unresolved) Casing of ./extension/sw-sales-channel/view/sw-sales-channel-detail-theme does not match the underlying filesystem  
> foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js:4:8
>
> ✘ [https://google.com/\#q=import%2Fno-unresolved](https://google.com/#q=import%2Fno-unresolved) Casing of ./init/api-service.init does not match the underlying filesystem  
> foobar/vendor/shopware/storefront/Resources/app/administration/src/main.js:6:8

The underlying problem is that Mac supports case-insensitive paths but not the tools that build the administration. Therefore, make sure to execute the commands in a context where the `pwd` is written in the correct case.

✅ Ok: `/Users/shopware/Code/shopware-platform`

❌ Not ok: `/users/shopware/code/Shopware-Platform`

## Next steps

As you installed Shopware successfully, maybe you want to start writing your very own plugin. Head over to [Plugin base guide](../plugins/plugins/plugin-base-guide.md) to get a grip on that topic. Did you know you can install Shopware on Mac with the help of other tools? See the guides below:

* [Docker](docker.md)
* [Vagrant](vagrant.md)
* [Dockware](dockware.md)
