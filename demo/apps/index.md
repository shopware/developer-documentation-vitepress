Leverage Shopware's extension APIs to build unique extensions that boost merchants businesses. Use the powerful plugin system to build highly custom extensions or build apps using your platform of choice.

## How to start

It doesn't take more than a text editor to get started developing apps. The easiest way to get going is through creating a Sandbox. **Developer sandboxes** are Shopware environments that you can use to test the API, develop Apps or explore features of the Shopware platform.
